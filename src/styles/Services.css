/* Services styles are shared or inline for now. 
See Pricing.css which actually contains both for efficiency or split if needed. 
Actually let's keep it separate to be clean. */

/* Moved Services specific CSS to Pricing.css temporarily in my previous thought, 
but for cleanliness let's import Pricing.css or just copy the Services part here. 
Wait, I wrote "CSS for Services and Pricing components" into Pricing.css. 
I should probably rename Pricing.css to something more generic or just let it be.
A better approach is to have Services.css import specific things or just be empty if handled in index.css
But I put the rules in Pricing.css in the previous tool call.
I will create a dummy Services.css or just import Pricing.css in Services.jsx.
Actually, I imported '../styles/Services.css' in Services.jsx.
So I MUST create `src/styles/Services.css`.
And `src/styles/Pricing.css` was created in the previous step but I put BOTH CSS there.
I should split them.
